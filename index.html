            <h2 id="main_description">Stone henge is located England which is north of Salisbury plain. The place consisted of 2 types of rocks; one being called Sarsen( the larger rocks) and the other being bluestone rock ( the smaller rocks). The Sarsen rocks they were said to weigh 20-30 tons and the bluestone rocks were said to weight 2-5 tons
    Stonehenge was said to have formed around 3000 BC where a circular ditch was initially made consisting of 100 meters in diameter. Then, the stone were imported starting with the large rocks on the outer circle and then the smaller rocks in the inner circle. Lastly the stones were then erected upright resulting in Stonehenge.
