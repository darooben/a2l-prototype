        <h2>What did the project make me learn?</h2>
        <p>It taught me about the approach I had to take to building a project which that consists the following: viewing and documenting the requirements which needs to be on the website, programmer techniques preferred to be used (for example using em instead of pixels as it scales better on different devices), documenting desired features/designs to be implemented into the website and managing time needed to complete this. I had to use a separate document in order to record it and using this, I was able to note all of this information down and use it during the design phase. For time management it helped me understand that providing estimated times/milestones I can complete the website faster and focus on certain tasks easier than all at once. This project also taught me how I had to use multiple different sources and combine them  to produce desired outcomes for my websites such as using videos and guides online to designs certain feature. (when creating a scroll effect that appears on an image as a header, I had to research multiple different features and combine them for it to work. This project also taught me about how there are standard design principles for coding that must be followed in the industry. My code also had to adapt to suit different screen sizes for different devices as well as making it accessible through semantic html.

        <h2>What choices were made when designing the website?</h2>
        <p>There were many choices I had to make during designing and coding the website. One of them was figuring out a good colour scheme. I wanted to make it look unique but also have the colours complement each other however that proved very difficult. I had to do research on colour theory on top of finding certain colours that the industry uses since they would work best (such as #Ffffff for the text). I had to use a website like ‘mycolour’ to determine a good palette for this project
    </p>
        <p>For structure and lay outing purposes, I did some research towards the website design principles and how people design websites in the industry and based my project around that.  For example, I did the following: my website follows the hierarchy for H tags with the banner holding the only h1 tag on the website as that is the first thing the user will see which would grab their attention, I added some whitespace in between section to maintain my website’s readability while also making it slightly compact so it doesn’t feel empty and I made sure that my more important sections such as sections with text be brought to focus by lowering the opacity of my images to make it stand out.
    </p>
        <p>In terms of accessibility, I made sure my code was as semantic as possible. I made sure that every image tag had the figure label and I made sure mini section used the section label instead of div keep it that way. I tried avoiding using div as much as possible but there was a problem involving the h tags being placed inside each section tag at least once. To overcome that I had to encase elements in the header tag and on the off chance I could not do that (when there were no elements to encase h tags in) it was kept limited.

        <h2>How can the skills help me learn Python when Im in level 1 for Python and C?</h2>
        <p>There were many skills I learnt through this project especially considering how this was the first website I have ever made. Some skills I learnt were the website I made consisted of multiple blocks which were divided into sections allowing me to keep the website structure and organised when I had organised the classes in CSS me. I can take this to level 1 where my code can be structured to have similar functions nearby to each other helping to keep it structured.
    </p>
        <p>Another skill I learnt from this project was docstring which although is not used on websites much. is something that is used in the industry a lot. I learnt doc string helps explain functions especially when hovering over the function name(as it appears inside it) which will definitely improve my commenting for future projects. For now I just used normal commenting but kept it straight to the point on what it does.
    </p>
        <p>In terms of creating code and debugging habits, I found that a lot of my project time was taken up due to heavily focusing on certain features (for example I originally, I experimented with animation that occurs based on your scrolling position using only CSS and it did work but I had to scrap it due to apparently being an experimental feature off CSS and not official) so I changed my approach so that now I implement all the base features and fix those problems before debugging the more finer niche problems. That way, I can save time when it comes to programming in level 1.
